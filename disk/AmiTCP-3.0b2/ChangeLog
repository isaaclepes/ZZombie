	init.c, server.c, entries.c, groupunit.c, passwdunit.c):
        Added support for DOS notifications, now the changes in passwd and
	group files are immediately visible with passwd and group maps.

Wed May 18 19:47:45 1994  Pekka Pessi  (ppessi@lk-hp-1.hut.fi)

      * libs/usergroup.library:
        Updated the usergroup.library documentation.

	Upgraded to version 3.7, merged enchanchements made by R. Knop.
	Major new feature is support of the Telnet protocol.

Mon May 16 01:09:27 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@gamma.hut.fi)

      * bin/rsh:
	Fixed bug which caused sending to stop if input was redirected
	from a (not small) file.

Sun May 15 16:04:20 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@gamma.hut.fi)

      * bin/showmount:
	Added sources to the source distribution.

Sat May 14 16:02:47 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@gamma.hut.fi)

Tue May  3 00:00:01 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@gamma.hut.fi)

      * Install_AmiTCP:
	Added copying of "libs" dir, which was missing.

      * netinclude: (errno.h, sys/errno.h):
	Removed the definition for the __sys_errlist. Changed the
	__sys_nerr to be a macro.

      * netinclude: (inetdlib.h)
	Removed from the distribution.

Mon Apr 25 14:51:19 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@gamma.hut.fi)

      * inetd: (inetd.c):
	Fixed bugs in server argument parsing.

Sat Apr 23 19:42:11 1994  Tomi Ollila  (too@gamma.hut.fi)
	
      * telnet, inet-handler:
        Fixes and changes to telnet. For DosPacket aborting,
	ACTION_STACK is now used. Telnet has now version 3.3

Fri Apr 22 15:09:10 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@gamma.hut.fi)

      * AmiTCP: (kern/amiga_log.c):
	Fixed the bug in log file/console name change notify function
	(NETTRACE's DosBase is no more used before initialization).

      * netstat: (util/netstat/netstat):
	Added resolving the IP addresses (by Pavel Troller
	<patrol@k332.feld.cvut.cz>). The resolving is done with AmiTCP
	command 'resolve', and can be bypassed with command line

Sun Apr 17 15:09:37 1994  Tomi Ollila  (too@lk-hp-11.hut.fi)

      * telnet, inet-handler: 
        Added new `AmiTCP/IP_telnet 3.1' (5760 bytes)
	Added preliminary ACTION_FORCE handling to inet-handler
	and chanded some error messages a bit more descriptive.

Wed Apr 13 11:49:37 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@gamma.hut.fi)

      * netlib: (serveraccept.c, autoinitd.c, init_inet_daemon.c,
	set_socket_stdio.c and others with minor modifications):
	Removed separate objects (serveraccept.o, autoinitd.o). The
	serveraccept() is now included in the net.lib. autoinitd.o
	functionality is now replaced with the standard autoinit module
	int the net.lib + the new init_inet_daemon() function, which
	obtains the server socket accepted by the inetd. The stdin,
	stdout, and stderr can be redirected to any socket with the new
	set_socket_stdio() function.

      * src/examples/serv:
        Added an simple example server, which uses stdio over the socket.
	The server is normally started by the inetd (an entry for the
	in.example must be added to db/inetd.conf), but if started at cli,
	it will operate over the normal stdin/stdout.

Fri Apr  8 18:22:29 1994  Tomi Ollila  (too@lk-hp-12.hut.fi)

      * netinclude:
        Fixed arpa/telnet.h to define some TELOPT macros even TELOPTS
	is not defined. One may need those macros but not that
	`telopts' string array. Updated inline/usergroup.h for
	gcc users.

Thu Apr  7 23:51:28 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@gamma.hut.fi)

      * netinclude:
	Added new file amitcp/types.h, which contains common type
	definitions, which were previously defined in several places
	around the netincludes. This is done because of the SAS/C GST
	system, which doesn't like same symbol being defined in more
	than one file.

Wed Apr  6 18:42:35 1994  Tomi Ollila  (too@lk-hp-12.hut.fi)

      * AmiTCP: (kern/amiga_netdb.[ch], kern/accesscontrol.c):
	Added symbol '@' as `Service' in access control lists
	to match with privileged ( < 1024) ports.

Tue Apr  5 20:19:36 1994  Tomi Ollila  (too@lk-hp-11.hut.fi)

      * tcp_AmiTCP, inet-handler:
        Updated and cleaned up a bit.

Mon Apr  4 04:42:27 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@gamma.hut.fi)

      * netlib:
	Added files popen.c (by Rick Schaeffer), sleep.c and usleep().
	popen.c implements UNIX compatible popen() and pclose() functions,
	sleep.c and usleep.c implement UNIX compatible sleep() and
	usleep() functions, respectively. 

Sat Apr  2 15:03:34 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@gamma.hut.fi)

      * AmiTCP: (api/amiga_api.c, api/amiga_api.h, api/amiga_generic2.c,
	api/gethostnamadr.c, api/res_init.c, api/res_mkquery.c,
	api/res_query.c, api/res_send.c, api/resolv.h, kern/amiga_main.c):
	Moved global resolver variables to the SocketBase, eliminating
	the need for the res_lock, which is removed. Added tag code
	SBTC_HERRNOLONGPTR for setting the h_errno pointer (LONG *).

      * netlib: (getherrno.c, autoinit.c, rcmd.c, Smakefile, GNUmakefile):
	Removed getherrno.c, added global h_errno and it's pointer passing
	to the autoinit.c, changed the rcmd.c to use newer netlib
	features.

      * netinclude: (netdb.h, amitcp/socketbasetags.h):
	Added external declaration of the h_errno to the netdb.h, added
	tag code SBTC_HERRNOLONGPTR to the amitcp/socketbasetags.h.

Tue Mar 29 16:00:00 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@gamma.hut.fi)

      * netlib: (utime.c):
	Added to the distribution.

      * netinclude: (utime.h):
	Added to the distribution.

Tue Mar 29 16:00:00 1994  Pekka Pessi  (ppessi@lk-hp-20.hut.fi)

	Moved all functionality to netlib.

Sat Mar 26 12:19:54 1994  Tomi Ollila  (too@lk-hp-11.hut.fi)

      * AmiTCP: (netinet/tcp_input.c, kern/accesscontrol.[ch],
	kern/amige_netdb.[ch] api/getxbyy.c
	Added simple (but efficient) access control to the protocol
	stack. Fixed bug in getservbyname() which now checks the
	protocol string. 

Tue Mar 22 11:21:59 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@lk-hp-11.hut.fi)

      * AmiTCP: (api/amiga_generic.c, api/amiga_generic2.c,
	api/amiga_syscalls.c, api/amiga_api.h, api/amiga_api.c,
	netinclude:amitcp/socketbasetags.h): 
	Added new field 'fdCallback' to the SocketBase, added new tag to
	SocketBaseTags() (SBTC_FDCALLBACK) for setting this function
	pointer. Added code to AmiTCP functions to call this callback
	whenever dTable changes.

      * netlib: (_allocufb.c, _chkufb.c, _close.c, _lseek.c, _open.c, 
	_read.c, _write.c, fhopen.c, ioctl.c, iomode.c, isatty.c, stat.c):
	Added the preliminary unix io compatibility code.
          
      * netinclude: (ios1.h):
	New file containing additions to SAS/C header with the same name
	(include:ios1.h). Defines flag UFB_SOCK for sockets.

Mon Mar 21 17:18:48 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@lk-hp-11.hut.fi)

      * binary distribution: (bin/netmount, doc/netfs.doc,

      * Added Sun RPC 4.0 to the distribution. New files and directories
	are: db/rpc, help/RPC.guide, netinclude/rpc, netinclude/rpcsvc,
	src/README.RPC, src/rpclib,  src/examples/rpc, src/doc/rpc,
	src/util/portmap, src/util/rpcinfo, src/devtools/cpp,
	src/devtools/rpcgen.

Tue Mar  8 00:47:37 1994  Pekka Pessi  (ppessi@lk-hp-20.hut.fi)

      * netinclude/Smake.template: the version tag includes now prefix
	string "AmiTCP/IP_".

      * Added new directory devtools to source tree.  Added rcsrev to
	source and api distribution.

      * src/util/ping/ping.c: Fixed a typo with version tag.

Sun Feb 27 17:05:21 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@lk-hp-11.hut.fi)

      * src/netlib/getherrno.c: new file, implements function GetHErrno(),
	which returns the host error code set by failing gethostbyname()
	or gethostbyaddr().

Sun Feb 27 01:26:47 1994  Pekka Pessi  (ppessi@lk-hp-4.hut.fi)

      * util/rsh/rsh.c, util/letnet/letnet.h: Updated <socketbasetags.h>
	usage to <amitcp/socketbasetags.h>

      * amitcp: Added autodoc files into api subdirectory (api/auto_*),
	added bsdsocket.doc as Smakefile target.  Updated
	SetSocketSignals(). 

      * protocols.dok:  Updated ARP and IF sections.

Sat Feb 26 06:15:53 1994  Pekka Pessi  (ppessi@lk-hp-4.hut.fi)

      * Updated DIST targets

      * Added src/libs subdirectory and usergroup.library; added
	netinfo.device. 

      * db: Updated interfaces file, added default values in comments

      * netinclude: Added include files for usergroup.library and
	netinfo.device. 

      *	netlib: Updated Smakefile.  Removed netlib.doc from DIST (it is
	created from sources)

      * utils: Updated the Smakefile, added a real VERSTAG to each
	utility, fixed small bugs with ping and inetd.  Changed the
	mechanism used to override the default ^C handling to use
	__chkabort(). Move finger and ls to util subdirectory (from appl),
	added id, login, passwd, resolve, rsh, umask and whoami utilities.
	
      * appl/napsaterm: Added bugfixes, updated texinfo documentation

Thu Feb 17 11:44:44 1994  Pekka Pessi  (ppessi@lk-hp-19.hut.fi)

      * netlib: (autoinit.c, autoinitd.c, timerinit.c):
        Fixed return type of autoinitialization functions (in SAS C >6.50
	they should return 0 on success)

Wed Feb 16 09:02:45 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@lk-hp-11.hut.fi)

	* netlib: (herror.c):
	Added name resolver error printing routine (herror()).

	* AmiTCP: (API, kern/subr_prf.c, sys/systm.h):
	Changed vcsprint() to do the formatting itself. All other
	functions now use it instead of Exec()'s RawDoFmt(). This has the
	implication that the format strings passed to the syslog() no
	longer need the 'l' modifiers for the integer data, since it is
	the default.

Mon Feb 14 19:41:47 1994  Pekka Pessi  (ppessi@lk-hp-5.hut.fi)

        * (netinclude/clib/sockat_inline.h): Changed the scope of inlined
	functions.

        * ping.c: Fixed the record routing option (-R), added loose routing
	option (-L).

Mon Feb 14 16:53:14 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@lk-hp-11.hut.fi)

	* AmiTCP: (api/amiga_api.c):
	Changed LogTag to default to NULL, since old apps will include the
	tag into the log message.

	* netlib: (autoinit.c, autoinitd.c):
	Added passing the program name via SocketBaseTags() at the startup
	(syslog will use it in forthcoming messages).

Fri Feb  4 00:22:07 1994  Pekka Pessi  (ppessi@lk-hp-5.hut.fi)

	* AmiTCP: (GNUmakefile, Smakefile, all_includes.h, net/if.c,
	net/if_sana.c, net/if_sana.h, api/amiga_generic.c, net/sana2arp.c,
	net/sana2config.c, net/sana2config.h, kern/amiga_cstat.c):
	Implemented the new-style interface names
	(slip.device/0 -> sl0)

	* db/interfaces: A new configuration file

	* AmiTCP: (kern/variables.src):
	Fixed some variable types

	* netlib: (GNUmakefile, Smakefile, autoinitd.c, lineread.c,
	printfault.c, rcmd.c, strerror.c, perror.c, stubs.c): 
	Added autodoc entries, fixed some typos and errors in documents
	and prototypes. Added perror() and some normally inlined stubs.

	* netinclude: (sys/a_ioctl.h, sys/ioctl.h, sys/param.h, sys/types.h,
	net/a_if.h, net/sana2tags.h, net/if.h, net/if_arp.h): 
	Added new-style interface names, removed interface tags.

	* netinclude: (grp.h, pwd.h, unistd.h, utmp.h, clib/netlib_protos.h):
	Added new protypes and declarations for usergroup.library and link
	library.

	* netinclude: (proto/socket.h, clib/socket_inlines.h): 
        Include inline functions only if SC option OPTINLINE is used.

Mon Jan 24 09:46:51 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@lk-hp-11.hut.fi)

	* net.lib: (src/netlib/strerror.c, syslog.c, autoinit.c,
	autoinitd.c, Smakefile, GNUmakefile):
	Updated netlib for release 3: removed errlst.c and gethostname.c,
	added strerror.c and syslog.c. strerror.c has strerror(), which
	uses error tables of the AmiTCP. syslog.c defines syslog utility
	functions: openlog(), closelog() and setlogmask().

	* netinclude: (syslog.h, sys/syslog.h, GNUmakefile):
	Added netinclude:syslog.h for source compatibility (it just
	includes sys/syslog.h). Added prototypes for openlog(),
	closelog() and setlogmask() to sys/syslog.h (these functions
	are now in the netlib).

	* AmiTCP: (net/sana2perror.c, net/sana2arp.c,
	kern/amiga_log.c, kern/amiga_subr.h, kern/amiga_main.c,
	Smakefile, GNUmakefile):
	Added net/sana2perror.c to AmiTCP distribution (was in
	netlib). Made small fixes for the SAS/C 6.51, raised version
	to 3.0(beta).

Sat Jan 22 13:40:01 1994  Tomi Ollila  (too@lk-hp-11.hut.fi)

	* netinclude/inline/socket.h
	Moved clib/socket_inlines.h stuff here since those had to be
	modified for gcc. Generated big list of defines to make 
	possible to use local `SocketBase' variable in calls to
	bsdsocket.library calls. This feature is invoked defining
	SOCKETBASE_IN_CONTEXT.

Fri Jan 21 14:02:34 1994  Pekka Pessi  (ppessi@lk-hp-3.hut.fi)

	* net.lib: (src/netlib/Smakefile, rmcd.c): 
	Removed getpwuid() and getgrgid() from link library. Added rcmd()
	and resvport().

Thu Jan 20 04:33:30 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@lk-hp-11.hut.fi)

	* AmiTCP: (api/amiga_generic2.c + many other api/ files):
	Changed SetErrnoPtr() to check its arguments. Errno size is now
	restricted to 4, 2 or 1 bytes. Address must also be even if the
	size is even. Also added a return value (formerly it was void): 0
	is returned on success, -1 on failure, which is due to illegal
	arguments (_old_ errno is set to EINVAL).

Wed Jan 19 01:07:35 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@lk-hp-11.hut.fi)

	* AmiTCP: (kern/amiga_log.c):
	AmiTCP now seeks to the end of an old log file when opening it.

	* AmiTCP: (api/amiga_generic2.c, api/amiga_libcallentry.h):
	syslog() (and vsyslog()) now support the '%m' feature of the BSD
	syslog().

Tue Jan 18 17:37:35 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@lk-hp-11.hut.fi)

	* AmiTCP: (netinclude:clib/socket_protos.h, api/gethostnamadr.c,
	api/apicalls_sasc.h, kern/amiga_config.h, kern/variables.src,
	kern/amiga_cstat.c, amiga_subr.h):
	Implemented gethostname() API function and HOSTNAME ARexx variable
	(QUERY/SET). The host name is queried from the netdb and/or name
	server, if it is not explicitly given in db/AmiTCP.config _or_ set
	with the ARexx SET command.

Mon Jan 17 10:14:45 1994  Pekka Pessi  (ppessi@lk-hp-2.hut.fi)

	* src/appl/GNUmakefile: updated the source tree for new Napsaterm
	version.

Fri Jan 14 16:29:58 1994  Tomi Ollila  (too@lk-hp-11.hut.fi)

	* tcp_AmiTCP:
	Added sending of custom packet to ABORT pending read packet
	when network closes the connection. This packet is FIFO
	spesific and won't do anything when using another handler.
	Anyway, it works with emacs which uses FIFO to communicate
	with spawned processes.

Thu Jan 13 09:38:30 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@lk-hp-11.hut.fi)

	* AmiTCP: (api/gethostnamadr.c, net/if.c, netinclude/net/if.h):
	Implemented gethostid(), added findid() to if.c to support it.
	(gethostid() caches the id.)

Wed Jan 12 09:38:47 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@lk-hp-11.hut.fi)

	* AmiTCP: (api/amiga_api.c api/amiga_api.h api/amiga_generic.c
	  api/amiga_generic2.c):
	Implemented SocketBaseTagList(). Added Syslog() related variables
	to the socket base. Moved dtable handling functions from
	api/amiga_generic.c to api/amiga_generic2.c.

	* netinclude: (socketbasetags.h, sys/cdefs.h)
	Added socketbasetags.h (for the SocketBaseTagList()). Moved
	sys/cdefs.h from amitcp/sys to netinclude:sys.

Fri Jan  7 17:50:03 1994  Tomi Ollila  (too@lk-hp-11.hut.fi)

	* AmiTCP: (api/amiga_generic.c api/amiga_api.c api/amiga_syscalls.c
	  api/amiga_generic2.c api/res_query.c api/resolv.c)
	Added several 3.0 API extensions. Changed socket allocation and 
	descriptor handling to use new socket usage bitmask which is
	stored right after descriptor table. Added new feature to 
	Dup2Socket(): now it marks fd2 as dummy socket in descriptor table
	when fd1 is given as -1. Added hError to socketbase.

	* AmiTCP: (api/amiga_syscalls.c api/amiga_sendrecv.cm api/sockargs.h)
	Added functions sendmsg() and recvmsg(). All send & recv functions
	are moved to amiga_sendrecv.c for easier update.

Wed Jan  5 12:40:36 1994  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@lk-hp-11.hut.fi)

	* AmiTCP: kern/amiga_log.c kern/amiga_rexx.c
	Changed the AmiTCP ARexx port (AMITCP) to show only after the API
	is up and running (no need to "wait" on the bin/startnet).

Mon Jan  3 21:47:09 1994  Pekka Pessi  (ppessi@lk-hp-17.hut.fi)

	* src/devs/rhslip/device_funcs.c, slip_device.h: 
	Added configureable MTU and EOFMODE to the rh(c)slip.device.

Fri Dec 31 03:29:48 1993  Pekka Pessi  (ppessi@lk-hp-15.hut.fi)

	* AmiTCP: kern/amiga_cstat.c, util/netstat/netstat.rexx
	Fixed the netmask dumping by getroutes(). 

AmiTCP/IP Release 2.3: (released 23.12.1993)
============================================

Thu Dec 23 09:24:24 1993  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@lk-hp-11.hut.fi)

	* distribution

Wed Dec 22 00:22:24 1993  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@lk-hp-11.hut.fi)

	* AmiTCP (kern/amiga_main.c, api/amiga_api.c, api/amiga_api.h
	  kern/amiga_config.c, kern/amiga_config.h):
	Added new ARexx command 'KILL', which will send break to AmiTCP,
	which will then try to break all processes which have the library
	open. If all processes quit, AmiTCP quits also.

	* AmiTCP (net/if_sana.c, net/if_sana.h, net/sana2tags.c, 
	  netinclude:net/sana2tags.h):
	Added tags for PPP, defined DOTRACK FALSE for Arcnet.
	Raised number of write requests for SLIP, PPP and default to be
	able to send large IP packets (fragmented). 

Sat Dec 18 17:30:53 1993  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@lk-hp-11.hut.fi)

	* AmiTCP (sys/mbuf.h, net/sana2copybuff.c, 
	  kern/uipc_socket.c, kern/uipc_socket2.c):
	Removed usage of M_EOR, which caused fragmented packets to be
	truncated.
	  
AmiTCP/IP Release 2.2: (released 21.11.1993)
============================================

Wed Nov 17 14:17:24 1993  Jarno Tapio Rajahalme  (jraja@lk-hp-11)

	* AmiTCP (kern/uipc_socket.c, kern/uipc_socket2.c):
	Fixed a bug inherited from the BSDSS4 code. Selecting processes
