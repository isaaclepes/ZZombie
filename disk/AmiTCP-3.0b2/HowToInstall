* How to Install AmiTCP/IP:

  You should not install the current version on top of older
  version.  If your disk space allows, leave the old version on the
  disk and delete it when you have the new version up and running. The
  installation script will copy your old configuration from old
  version directory.
  
  Extract first the distribution archives (AmiTCP_xxx_xx.lha) to some
  directory in your hard disk (e.g. WORK:).

* Configuration Information
  
  Before you proceed, you should get the following information from
  your network administration (if you don't have the information, you
  have to reinstall AmiTCP/IP afterwards):
  
  * Internet protocol address for your computer. This is a 32 bit
    integer represented as a series of decimal numbers separated by
    dots. For example, 130.233.161.40 is a legal internet address.

  * If you have a point-to-point connection to the network, you need
    to know your destination IP address, that is the IP address of
    the host you are connected. SLIP, CSLIP and PPP are examples of
    point-to-point connections.
  
  * Netmask for your network. This specifies how many bits of your
    internet address are used to specify the network address. Netmask
    is like 255.255.255.0. If your network is not sub-netted, then do
    not have to supply this value (a default computed from the IP
    address is used).
  
  * Address of the default gateway. If your host do not know any route
    to a host it resorts to the default gateway. If you have only one
    point-to-point connection, you should use the host you are
    connected as a default gateway.
  
  * Your host name. Host name is a more convenient way than the internet
    address to refer your computer. This is like `Amiga1'.
  
  * Domain name of your site. For example, "hut.fi" is the domain name
    for the Helsinki University of Technology in Finland. The part
    after the first dot in your full host name is usually (but not
    always) your domain name.
  
  * Addresses of the Domain Name Servers which will be used to
    translate host names to the corresponding internet addresses. A
    local database must be used instead if there is no name server on
    your domain.
  
    If you have an access to a Unix machine in your network, you can
    probably find a list of domains and name server addresses in the
    file `/etc/resolv.conf'. Also, if there is no name server, you can
    copy the file `/etc/hosts' to the `AmiTCP:db/hosts'.

  Next you should obtain a SANA-II compatible device driver for your
  network adapter. The SANA-II drivers are usually installed into
  directory `DEVS:networks'. We have included a few freely
  distributable drivers with the AmiTCP/IP. You can use the SLIP or
  CSLIP drivers with a serial interface.

  AmiTCP/IP uses a mnemonic name of SANA-II device driver to access
  it. The name and parameter mapping is specified in the configuration
  file db/interfaces. You should also know the number of unit you are
  using (usually 0). You might also have to make a configuration file
  for your device driver. The configuration files have usually the
  name of the interface appended with unit number and `.config', e.g.
  unit 1 of rhslip.device uses the configuration file `slip1.config'.
  Configuration files are usually stored into the directory
  `ENV:Sana2/'. See the example configuration file for the slip.device
  unit 0 at the end of this file.
  
  You may start the installation by double-clicking the
  "Install_AmiTCP"-icon.
  
  If you use slip.device or cslip.device SANA-II drivers, you _must_
  edit the configuration files before starting AmiTCP.

* About User and Group Databases

  AmiTCP/IP gives some user management support. For each user, there
  is one line of information in the file AmiTCP:db/passwd, which is
  currently used by `finger' and `ls' commands.  This line is
  separated to 7 parts with vertical bars (`|'):

username|password|uid|gid|gecos|home directory|shell

  The `gecos' part contains real name, office, office phone and home
  phome numbers separated with commas (',').  You can print them with
  finger. Markus Peuhkuri has following entry in the example `passwd'
  file:

puhuri|*|17681|100|Markus Peuhkuri,G218,4512462,4521992|users:puhuri|shell

  Markus has username puhuri. As the password field contains `*', his
  password is disabled (so he can not log into your machine even if
  the remote login is installed). His numeric identifier, UID, is
  17681, and his default group number, GID, is 100, `users'. The UID
  and GID must be numbers between 0 - 65535. After his real name there
  is his office room at HUT, is work phone and his home phone.  His
  home directory is `users:puhuri', finger searches his `.plan' and
  `.project' files from that directory. Last field is his login shell,
  AmiTCP/IP does not currently use that for anything.

  You can add and remove users simply editing your `passwd' file with
  text editors (Emacs, Ed, Edit). Make sure that finger can parse the
  changed file and finger each user that you have changed.

  The passwd file format is mostly compatible with MultiUser by Geert
  Uytterhoeven and with AS225r2 beta from Commodore. You can use `ls'
  with MultiUser or other filesystems which have WB3.0 compatible
  interface. If you are using MultiUser, you should copy or link your
  MultiUser passwd file to AmiTCP:db/passwd (install script tries to
  copy automatically, but it does not have enough intelligence to do
  it always right).

  The group file, `AmiTCP:db/group' has similar format. There is more
  information about group and password files in AutoDoc file
  AmiTCP:db/doc/netlib.doc.

* If There Is Some Problems with Installation 
  
  Here is an example of the required information:

	Name of your computer:	 		slip-2
	Your domain part: 			hut.fi
	Aliases for it: 			amy
	Your Internet address: 			130.233.161.50
	Destination address (terminal server):	130.233.161.90
	Netmask of used in your network:	255.255.252.0
	Address of the default gateway: 	130.233.163.254
	Domain names to search:			hut.fi
						cs.hut.fi
	Addresses of nameservers: 		130.233.224.1
						130.233.224.13  
						128.214.4.29
	SANA-II device driver: 			slip.device 
		(Serial Line IP)
	Unit of the SANA-II device driver: 	0 
	Name of the interface (db/interfaces):	slip0
   
  `AmiTCP:bin/StartNet' (lines beginning with `;' are comments):

	run AmiTCP:AmiTCP
	SYS:Rexxc/WaitForPort AMITCP
	; configure loop-back device
	AmiTCP:bin/ifconfig lo0 localhost
	; Configure slip0
	AmiTCP:bin/ifconfig slip0 130.233.161.50 +
	130.233.161.90 netmask 255.255.252.0
	; Add route to this host
	AmiTCP:bin/route add slip-2.hut.fi localhost
	; Add route to the default gateway
	AmiTCP:bin/route add default 130.233.163.254
	; Start the internet `super server'
	run AmiTCP:bin/inetd

  `Amitcp:db/netdb-myhost' (lines beginning with `;' are comments):

	; This host
	HOST 130.233.161.50 slip-2.hut.fi slip-2 amy
	; Domain names
	DOMAIN hut.fi
	DOMAIN cs.hut.fi
	; Name servers
	NAMESERVER 130.233.224.1
	NAMESERVER 130.233.224.13
	NAMESERVER 128.214.4.29

  `S:User-Startup' will contain something along following lines (if
  you do not choose to start AmiTCP at the system startup):
  
	;BEGIN AmiTCP/IP
	setenv HOSTNAME slip-2.hut.fi
	assign AmiTCP: Work:AmiTCP-x.x
	path AmiTCP:bin add
	;END AmiTCP/IP

  Example of ENV:sana2/slip0.config:

	serial.device 0 19200 130.233.161.50

  Note that the baud rate must match the baud rate of the terminal
  program used for dialing!

* What Happens in the Installation?
  
  The course of installation is shortly explained for those of you who
  want to know what happens to their computer:

  * Amount of free memory and version of system software is checked
  * Destination directory is asked for
  * An earlier installation is checked in the destination directory,
    so you can change your setup by running the installation script
    again
  * The AmiTCP/IP files are copied to the destination if needed
  * Included Sana-II device drivers are installed
  * Example configuration files for the SANA-II drivers are copied to
    ENVARC:sana2/ 
  * EmacsTCP is installed 
  * NapsaTerm is installed
  * User and group databases are installed. They are useful when
    dealing with Unix or multiuser filesystems.
  * You are queried some information concerning your network setup:
    * Your host and domain name name is stored to the environment
      variable HOSTNAME
    * You are asked for aliases (nicknames) for your host
    * You are asked for the name, unit of the interface you are using
    * Likewise the interface (and destination) IP addresses and
      netmask are asked
    * You are asked for the IP address of the default gateway
    * You are asked for domain names and domain name server IP
      addresses
  * If you select to start AmiTCP/IP when your computer boots,
    appropriate command is added to your s:user-startup.
  * S:user-startup is modified to make right assigns and paths.
  * Installer creates Amitcp:bin/startnet, a script to start
    AmiTCP/IP, configure Sana-II interfaces and provide basic routing
  * Other network information is saved in the file
    AmiTCP:db/netdb-myhost
