		Note to AmiTCP/IP beta testers
		==============================


PLEASE READ CAREFULLY
---------------------

	This is a BETA release of the AmiTCP/IP. There is no bugs
	(note the omissions section below, however), that we would be
	aware of, but we thought that it would be wise to test it more
	before release. Please do not distribute this too widely,
	since even INCOMPATIBLE changes WILL BE MADE to the actual
	release, if there are good reasons to do so.

	So, you have been warned!


A wish for all application developers
-------------------------------------

	One purpose of this beta release is to give you some time to
	update your applications to use the new features of the AmiTCP
	distribution, so that they would be available when the actual
	AmiTCP/IP release 3.0 ships.

	So, please recompile all your AmiTCP code and use the new
	features. Take special care with the following:

		3.0 beta 2:

		- The net.lib implements the level 1 I/O functions,
		  replacing the functions of the sc.lib. This
		  functionality is highly compiler (or link library)
		  specific, and is tested on SAS/C 6.51 sc.lib only.
		  On the bright side, this should make porting those
		  applications _mush_ easier!

		- The library functions for starting an inetd started
		  daemon have changed. See the
		  src/examples/serv/in.example.c for an example.
		  The binary interface with the inetd has not changed,
		  though.
		  
		3.0 beta (1):

		- user informations should now be get with the
		  usergroup.library. All you need to do is to include
		  the usr.lib to the link and _use_ the functions
		  provided.

		- also the path to the user home directory is got from
		  the usergroup.library, so please change all
		  user-specific files to be stored/taken to/from
		  there.

		- AmiTCP now adds the program name automatically to
		  every syslog message.

		- you need now longer need to use the `l' modifiers
		  with the syslog(), since all arguments are expected
		  to be longs.

		- SetDTableSize() no longer exists (it was changed to
		  getdtablesize() so old programs will work just fine,
		  the table size just is not changed).
		  SocketBaseTagList() now has a tag for setting the
		  dtable size.

		- interface names are now only 16 chars long (the BSD
		  style). This will not need any changes to your
		  source.

	Please read the README.FIRST carefully, since it should
	contain notes of all API changes.


Omissions of this beta release
------------------------------

	- The installation script (Install_AmiTCP) is not at the best
	  with the new way to handle the interfaces.
	- AmiTCP/IP documentation is still not included in the
	  distribution. This will be on the actual release, however.
	- portmap is single threaded by now, so some of the rpcinfo
	  operations will just not work (they wait until the
	  timeout hits).


Few notes on setting up the AmiTCP/IP 3.0 beta
----------------------------------------------

	Since the interface names have been modified, your
	bin/startnet script has to be changed.

	The db/interfaces contains defaults for the a2065.device,
	a2060.device, ax25.device, rhcslip.device and rhslip.device,
	which should be changed as follows:

		a2065.device/0	-> ether0
		a2060.device/0	-> arcnet0
		ax25.device/0	-> axdm0
		rhcslip.device/0 -> cslip0
		rhslip.device/0	-> slip0

	The interface names are fully configurable by editing the
	db/interfaces file.

	Note that online/offline still takes the name of the actual
	sana2 device driver on the old format (or '/' replaced by a
	blank). Note also, that these still need the 'networks/'
	prefix on the device name.

	In addition to changing the interface name you should delete
	the `wait 2' line, which is not needed any more.

	Then you should add following line to the end of the script:

		AmiTCP:bin/login -f <your-user-name>

	The "-f" option causes the login not to ask the password at
	all. If you leave that off, the password is asked normally.

	This requires you to edit the db/passwd to include a proper
	entry for your login name.

	Also note that taking the ">nil:" redirections, which you have
	probably added to the bin/startnet commands, away makes your
	setting up easier, since you will see any possible error
	messagas generated by the commands :-)
