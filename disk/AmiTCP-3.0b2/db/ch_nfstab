# This is a short introduction for the impatient.
#
# 1. Legal stuff
# 
# Before using the programs in this archive make sure you know
# that you use them at your own risk. See ch_nfsc.guide/DISCLAIMER for
# detailed info on this topic. See ch_nfsc.guide/COPYING for
# copyright and copying permissions.
# 
# 2. Here's a small example 
#
# a) Let's assume we want to mount the partition "/home/user" from
#    host "nfsserver". We want to make all NFS accesses as user "ch"
#    as listed in "AmiTCP:db/passwd" and the local volume name should 
#    be "nfs:". The umask should be 0755.
#
#    So you have to create a file containing the following line:
#
nfsserver:/home/user nfs: USER ch UMASK 0755 
#
#    Comments are possible using the '#' as the comment marker.
# 
# b) Use the following to mount "nfs:".
#
#	CLI> ch_nfsmount nfs: from short.doc
#
#
# (Note that the file you are reading now is a legal input file to 
#  ch_nfsmount.)
#
# 3.) The default input file for "ch_nfsmount" is 
#     "AmiTCP:db/ch_nfstab".
#     You should copy "ch_nfsc" to "AmiTCP:bin" and all the other 
#     files to a directory listed in your path.
#
# (Note: If "ch_nfsc" is not found in "AmiTCP:bin" it will
#  be searched for in the actual path.)
#
