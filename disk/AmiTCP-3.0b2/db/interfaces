# Network Interface Configuration for AmiTCP/IP
# =============================================
#
# AmiTCP/IP uses the network interface to communicate with SANA-II devices,
# just like DOS uses handlers or filesystems to communicate with exec
# devices.  A network interface is created and configured with `ifconfig'
# utility.  AmiTCP/IP can create several network interfaces for each SANA-II
# device; this is seldom useful, except when network has many different
# framings for IP.
#
# The new-style network interface name consists of interface device name
# concatenated with interface unit number, ie. if the interface name is
# "slip0", then the interface device name is "slip" and the interface unit
# is 0.  The network interface name should not contain digits ('0' ... '9').
#
# There is a built-in interface "lo0" in AmiTCP/IP, other interfaces should
# be defined here.
#
# This configuration file is read with template:
# NAME/A, DEV=DEVICE/A/K, UNIT/N/K, IPTYPE/N/K, ARPTYPE=IPARPTYPE/N/K,
# IPREQ=IPREQUESTS/N/K, ARPREQ=ARPREQUESTS/N/K, WRITEREQ=WRITEREQUESTS/N/K,
# NOTRACKING/S, NOARP/S, ARPHDR/N/K, P2P=POINT2POINT/S, NOSIMPLEX/S,
# LOOPBACK/S
#
# Lines can be continued if their last character is '+'
# '#' and ';' are comment characters - rest of the line is ignored
#
# Parameters are interpreted as follows:
# NAME/A
#   new-style AmiTCP/IP network interface name
# DEV=DEVICE/A/K
#   Sana-II (old-style AmiTCP/IP) device name
# UNIT/N/K
#   Sana-II (old-style AmiTCP/IP) device unit number. Default value is 0.
#   If no Sana-II unit number is given, the interface unit number is used
# IPTYPE/N/K (*
#   Packet type (framing) for Internet Protocol (IP)
# IPREQ=IPREQUESTS/N/K
#   IO requests allocated for receiving IP packets.
# ARPTYPE=IPARPTYPE/N/K (*
#   Packet type (framing) for Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
# ARPREQ=ARPREQUESTS/N/K
#   IO requests allocated for receiving ARP packets
# WRITEREQ=WRITEREQUESTS/N/K
#   IO requests allocated for transmitting packets
# NOTRACKING/S
#   Disable the packet type tracking on SANA-II devices.  This feature is
#   needed to circumvent a bug in a2060.device V37.2 
# NOARP/S
#   Disable the ARP for this interface
# ARPHDR/N/K (*
#   The ARP header version. This is 1 for Ethernet, 7 for Arcnet by default
# P2P=POINT2POINT/S
#   Use the device as point-to-point device
# NOSIMPLEX/S
#   Disable the copying of broadcast packets.  Set this parameter if we hear
#   our own broadcasts
# LOOPBACK/S
#   Set this parameter if it is loopback
#
# *) Don't set these parameters if you don't know what you are doing.
#    AmiTCP/IP recognizes Ethernet, Arcnet (RFC 1051 framing), SLIP and PPP
#    drivers automatically.  See file <netinclude/net/sana2tags.h> for the
#    packet types used for these drivers.
