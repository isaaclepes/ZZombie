SynClock                AmiTCP/IP User Commands                 SynClock

NAME
        SynClock -- Synchronice your Amiga clock from remote host

SYNOPSIS
        SynClock HOST/A,SAVE/S

DESCRIPTION 
        SynClock is mixed Shell and ARexx script that sets your Amiga
        system clock using DATE command and the information obtained
        from network.  The HOST parameter is required to know where the
        information is to be obtained (daytime service (port 13) is
        used). The optional SAVE parameter makes SynClock to save the
        new date and time to the battery-backed clock of your amiga.

REQUIREMENTS
        AmiTCP/IP must be running and TCP: device mounted before this
        command can be executed. ARexx is used since using it makes
        script faster than using normal shell features.
