NAME
     in.fingerd - remote user information server

SYNOPSIS
     in.fingerd file

DESCRIPTION
     Fingerd is a simple protocol based on RFC742 that provides an interface
     to the Name and Finger programs at several network sites.  The program is
     supposed to return a friendly, human-oriented status report on either the
     system at the moment or a particular person in depth.  There is no re­
     quired format and the protocol consists mostly of specifying a single
     `command line'.

     Fingerd is started by inetd when it receives a TCP connection request
     at port 79.  Once connected it reads a single command line terminated by
     a <CRLF> which is passed to finger.  Fingerd closes its connections as
     soon as the output is finished.

     If the line is null (i.e. just a <CRLF> is sent) then finger returns a
     `default' report, file given as its argument.

     If a user name is specified (e.g.  eric<CRLF>) then the response lists
     more extended information for that particular user, whether logged in or
     not.  Allowable `names' in the command line include both `login names'
     and `user names'.

BUGS
     Connecting directly to the server from a TIP or an equally narrow-minded
     TELNET-protocol user program can result in meaningless attempts at option
     negotiation being sent to the server, which will foul up the command line
     interpretation.  Fingerd should be taught to filter out IAC´s and perhaps
     even respond negatively (IAC WON'T) to all option commands received.

     Fingerd requires the APipe handler installed and mounted in the system
     for correct operation.

HISTORY
     The fingerd command appeared in 4.3BSD.
