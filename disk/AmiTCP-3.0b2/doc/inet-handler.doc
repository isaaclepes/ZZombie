inet-handler            AmiTCP/IP User Manual           inet-handler

NAME
	inet-handler  --  An easy and useful access to internet.

SYNOPSIS
	Mount TCP: from AmiTCP:devs/inet-mountlist

USAGE
	Usually the mounting shown above is done automatically at 
	AmiTCP/IP startup. After this Internet can be accessed by
	openign TCP: device from shell commands or another programs.

	Filename path after TCP: is used as command line arguments
	after all slashes '/' are changed to spaces. The command
	template is as follows...

	H=HOST,P=PORT,S=SERVICE/K,O=OBTAIN/K

	If host and port is given, system tries to connect the requested
	destination. Service is synonym to port -- and therefore cannot
	be used together. If only port is given handler binds to this
	port and leaves file unopened until someone connects to it...
	i.e acts as a server. if OBTAIN is given, handler tries to get
	already opened socket with the id provided (usually used with
	inetd). OBTAIN cannot be used together with anything else.

	Normally when there is more than one item in template that does
	not require a keyword the first keywordless argument goes to
	first template item introduced an so on. However since with
	this handler, port can be given alone, but host not, the only
	keywordless argument goes to port if port not already given
	with keyword. This makes handler usage easier for humans.
 
EXAMPLES
	Open 2 shell windows. Enter `type TCP:127' on one of the shells.
	Enter `copy * TCP:localhost/127' on another. Now you can write 
	some words on second window and those appear on first as you press
	RETURN. This idea can be used th have 2-Way chat with your friend.

	Use the 2 shell windows you have opened. Enter `newshell tcp:16333'
	on one and try `letnet localhost 16333' on another. You should see
	the starting shell info and command prompt appear in your 'letnet'
	window. Enter `endcli' and you get back where you started from.

	In the previous example. you can change the 'letnet' to 'telnet'
	from remote host. i.e Log on your Amiga. Currently this is not
	fully supported so you must end every command with ';' since
	NewShell cannot handle the trailing CR that comes with telnet.

	Enter `type TCP:your.favorite.remote.host/daytime'.

	TCP: can be used wery easy in arexx scripts and also in other
	programming languages. I suggest you use keywords when writing
	code that machine executes.
