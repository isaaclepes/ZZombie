NAME
       showmount - show mount information for an NFS server

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/showmount [ -aedh ] [ host ]

DESCRIPTION
       showmount  queries  the  mount daemon on a remote host for
       information about the state of  the  NFS  server  on  that
       machine.   With  no  options  showmount  lists  the set of
       clients who are mounting from that host.  The output  from
       showmount is designed to appear as though it were process­
       esed through ``sort -u''.

OPTIONS
       -a     List both the client hostname and mounted directory
              in host:dir format.

       -d     List only the directories mounted by some client.

       -e     Show the NFS server's export list.

       -h     Suppress the decriptive headings from the output.

SEE ALSO
       mountd(8), nfsd(8)

BUGS
       The  completeness  and  accurary  of  the information that
       showmount displays varies according to  the  NFS  server's
       implementation.

       Because showmount sorts and uniqs the output, it is impos­
       sible to determine from the output  whether  a  client  is
       mounting the same directory more than once.
