NAME
        telnet -- Network Virtual Terminal program for logging to a
                  remote host

SYNOPSIS
        telnet HOST/A,SERVICE

DESCRIPTION
        Telnet communicated with another host using TELNET protocol.

        Once a connection has been opened, telnet enters input mode.
        In this mode, text typed is sent to the remote host.  The
        input mode entered will be either "character at a time" or
        "line by line" depending on what the remote system supports.

        In "character at a time" mode, most text typed is immediately
        sent to the remote host for processing.

        In "line by line" mode, all text is echoed locally, and only
        completed lines are sent to the remote host. This version of
        telnet uses the COOKED mode of interface handler to provide
        locally echoed line by line mode.

        While connected to a remote host, telnet command mode may be
        entered by typing the telnet "escape character". That is
        `^C' (control-c) when operating in line-by-line mode and `^]'
        (control-right-bracket)) in character mode.
        This version of telnet has a simple one-character command
        options, which are the following:

                ^]  -- send ctrl-], only available at character mode.

                 r  -- resume session, continues the session normally.

                 q  -- quit telnet. closes connection and exits.

                 c  -- tries to enter character mode. remote host may
                                                forbid this.

                 l  -- enters line-by-line mode.

                 ?  -- shows this command list on user's terminal.


        Telnet may fail when user has written an unknown hostname or
        service. There is a possibility that TCP/IP is not running
        or TCP: not mounted. 

REQUIREMENTS
        Inet-handler 1.73 (or newer) must be mounted as TCP: in your
        machine and you must be running inet-handler compatible TCP/IP
        protocol stack such as AmiTCP/IP.
